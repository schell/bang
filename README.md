# bang #

What do you get after the Flash? The bang!
`bang` is a javascript scene graph framework for rendering 2D (and soon 3D) 
display lists. It takes some inspiration from Adobe's Flash and seeks to
supplant the Flash Actionscript API in your web authoring toolchain. 
Using the canvas tag `bang` enables you to create rich media applications, 
games and advertising widgets. 

Come on in, the API is just fine.
